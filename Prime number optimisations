when number = 12, this program takes 13 steps. 4 + 6 + 2 + 1
when number = 43, this program takes 28 steps. 4 + 21 + 2 + 1
when number = 10001, this program takes 5007 steps. 4 + 5000 + 2 + 1
1. the number of steps this program takes depends on the value of number
2. it is proportional to the value of number
3. it is actually equal to number/2

time complexity of the program is the number of steps taken by the program
big O notation: O(n)

naive approach is the most basic approach. time complexity = big O (n)
optimisation 1: to do it for only number/2. time complexity = big O (n)
optimisation 2: to break out of the loop if total is greater than 1. time complexity = big O (n)
optimisation 3: to do it for only sqrt (number). time complexity = big O (sqrt(n))
